It is known as the ‘hottest place on the planet’, and that is no joke. Geothermal activity in summer causes temperates to reach as high as 55 degrees celsius.",

The most important of all seasonings is responsible for a heck of a lot more than people realise, so there’s an extra special joy to the Uyuni Salt Flat. Of course, nobody really comes here to ponder the importance of salt. They come to see something truly incredible: nearly 11,000 square kilometres of flat land that is simultaneously otherworldly and very much of this place.",
